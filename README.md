## Order-Brushing-Detection
This is my solution to the given problem in attached file. 
The Problem is from Shopee Code League Week 1.
Order brushing is done based on the data given 'order_brush_order.csv'.

Abnormal user behaviours on e-commerce platforms can be detected in various ways. 
For example, if an item in a shop is a best seller but many of its orders come from the same buyer, we have reason to suspect that the seller is conducting order brushing.
Order brushing is a technique that may be employed by sellers to create fake orders in order to inflate the seller's or a particular item's rating, which may likely push that seller's item up the search results.

## Task
- Identify all shops that are deemed to have conducted order brushing. 
- Then for each shop that is identified to have conducted order brushing, identify the buyers suspected to have conducted order brushing for that shop.
